# Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability

This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
Use is at your own risk. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be
liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software
or the use or other dealings in the software.

# Contribution Requirement

By obtaining, installing, or using this software, you agree to contribute back to the
project within a reasonable timeframe (recommended within 90 days of first production
or sustained development use). Contribution may take ONE OR MORE of the following forms:

1. Submitting at least one meaningful bug report or issue.
2. Improving documentation (clarity, accuracy, examples, translations).
3. Providing a security disclosure (responsible, private first) if you discover a vulnerability.
4. Contributing code (feature, refactor, test coverage, performance improvements) via a pull request.
5. Sharing benchmarks or case studies that help guide future development.
6. Sponsoring or donating to project maintenance.

If you are unable to contribute directly, you are encouraged (but not legally required under
the permissive license) to promote the project or help other users adopt it responsibly.

# Relationship to License

This contribution expectation is a community norm, not a modification of the existing open
source license (e.g., MIT). The original license terms govern legal rights; this document
expresses the stewardship model preferred by the maintainers.

# Non-Compliance

Failure to contribute does not terminate your license rights, but large-scale or ongoing
closed/internal usage without any form of reciprocity is discouraged and may be publicly
noted in aggregate usage metrics if collected.

# No Additional Warranties

Contributions do not create any warranty, support obligation, service-level agreement, or
liability on the part of maintainers.

# Acknowledgment

By continuing to use this software, you acknowledge this disclaimer and the community
expectation of reciprocal contribution.
