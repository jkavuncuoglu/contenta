-// NOTE: This file used to provide a fetch-based shim for axios; it has been replaced
-// with an Inertia-backed implementation in `resources/js/lib/api.ts`.
-// We re-export `api` here for backwards compatibility so imports of '@/plugins/axios'
-// keep working while the codebase migrates fully to Inertia.
